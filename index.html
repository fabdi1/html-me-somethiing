		            <h2>Quick Recap of Last Season</h2>
		                <p> 
                            The 2016/17 season was Arsenal's 97th consecutive year in the top flight of English Football. Unfortunately it was the
                            the roughest showing the have mustered in the past two decades, culminating with Arsenal finishing outside a top four position,
                            the first time in 22 years. Finishing in fifth place last year means that Arsenal will not be participating in the Champions 
                            League this season, a seperate tourney that runs concurrent with the Premiere League season, reserved for all the top clubs in European Football.
                            Arsenal fans did have one the thing to be merry about, winnging the FA Cup, a domestic cup, the oldest association cup in the world.
                            It was there 13th FA Cup title, the most for any English Club, a title which eased the pressure on the team.

                    <h2> New Look, New season!</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Unlike traditional pro sports here in the U.S., football clubs tweak there jersey design after every season. Also, private companies pay lage sums of money
                        to have there logo plastered on the front of the jersey, arsenal being sponsored by Emirates Airlines. Traditionaly Arsenal weare a bright red shirt with white sleeves,
                        white shorts, and white socks for the home kit. This year home jersey includes a collar  with some fancy gold piping down the sides. Personally I have yet to grow 
                        an affinity for the duds Puma have been providing Arsenal, but this year I think it looks pretty good. The away kit for this year is a striking blue top with a hooped collar
                        and a darker blue for the shorts with blue socks. The third kit this year is black with a polo collar and pink highlights and lettering.

		            <h2> Summer Transfer Window </h2>
                        <p> 
                            The Transfer Window, starting mid June, and lasting until the end of August, represents a stretch of rougly 12 weeks of summer in between seasons 
                            in which football clubs can trade or purchase players from other squads with a sum of monies, called a transfer fee. Fueled 
                            by 24/7 media scrutiny, wild rumours, and massive deals, it is just as exciting and excruciating as when the season actually kicks off. 
                            Historically, Arsenal are either sellers in the market, budding you talent poached by big sprending bitter rivals, 
                            or on the flip side, bringing in world class talent to a key posistions were help is sorely needed.
                        </p>

                               <figcaption><p class="arsenal">Will he stay or will he go?</p></figcaption> 
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            
                            The drama of this summers transfer window centered around key man Alexis Sanchez, arguably the best player in the League let alone Arsenal Football Club.
                            The Colombians contract with Arsenal is due up at the end of this season, which left manager Arsene Wenger in a precarious position.
                            Either cash in on Alexis and recoup what was spent on bringing him in 3 yeaars ago, or keep him on for the year, with the likely outcome of him leaving on a free transfer
                            as he would be out of contract at seasons end.
                            Arsene by my own addmition wisely decided to keep Alexis as he will be an integral part to the success of the club this upcoming season. Without it I believe it would be
                            an uphill battle to challenge the other top clubs in the league. Arsenal did acquire two exeptional players to bolster the squad, the mercurial frenchmen Alexandre Lacazette from
                            Lyon for a club record fee of &euro;53 millon euros and Saed Kolasinac, by way of free transfer from the German outfit Schalke.

	                <h2> Looking into the Crystal Ball</h2>
                    <p>
                         Expectations for Arsenal this season really has hit a nadir. A different air hangs over the Emirates, a cloud of uncertainty and uneasiness due to
                         the transfer saga of Alexis Sanchez and the belief that our current squad is not strong enough to contend, proven by resent performances on the pitch.
                         The team sheet is still filled with world class players and will definitely win a bunch a games, but truth be told, is it strong enough to contend for a title?
                         Manchesters two teams improved vastly as always, Liverpool is on the rise, and cross town rivals Tottenham are posed for a good run too, finishing above Arsenal last year
                         since who knows when. Manager Arsene Wenger, the gaffer who has managed arsenal since 1995, will always be held in high regards by all for what he has done for the club.
